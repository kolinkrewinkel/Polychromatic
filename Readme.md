#Polychromatic  

Coloring with significance.

Polychromatic is an Xcode plugin that makes code logic clear and apparent. It gives properties, ivars, and local variables each a unique, dynamic color, stripping away emphasis from types which don't need it.

###Installation
*Xcode 5 or later is required.*

To install from the Releases, place the downloaded plugin file `Polychromatic.xcplugin` into `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/`. If the directory doesn't already exist, create the path.

###Install-by-Compilation & Developing
Cloning the source and opening the project will allow you to build the plugin. Building will automatically copy it to the Plug-ins directory, even if you do not run. Running will allow you to debug and attach to Xcode (via Polychromatic), opening a second instance.
